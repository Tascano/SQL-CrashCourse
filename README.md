# SQL-CrashCourse

ðŸŽ“ The Backend & Data Engineer's SQL Masterclass
ðŸŽ¯ Course Objective
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Design, create, and manage relational databases using DDL.
2. Write complex analytical and transactional SQL queries using DQL.
3. Apply advanced techniques like Window Functions and CTEs.
4. Understand and implement database concepts: normalization, constraints, indexing, and optimization.
5. Model real-world data systems, reason about production design, and confidently solve data engineering SQL interview problems from companies like Scribd, Airbnb, Meta, and Netflix.
