# Section 1 ‚Äî SQL & Database Foundations
This section lays the groundwork by introducing core database terminology and the five categories of SQL commands.

1.1 The Database Landscape

| Concept | Explanation | Analogy |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Database | An organized collection of related data, usually stored electronically on a computer system. | A filing cabinet that holds many folders. |
| Table (Relation) | A collection of data organized into rows (records) and columns (fields). | A single folder inside the cabinet, holding similar types of documents. |
| Schema | The structure/design of the database‚Äîit defines how the data is organized, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships. | The index or blueprint that shows all the folders, what papers they hold, and how they relate. |

1.2 Keys and Constraints
Keys and Constraints are rules enforced by the database to ensure Data Integrity (accuracy and consistency).

| Concept | Explanation | Example (from users table) |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Primary Key (PK) | A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Must be NOT NULL and UNIQUE. | user_id |
| Foreign Key (FK) | A column (or set of columns) in one table that refers to the Primary Key of another table. It establishes a link between tables. | user_id in the engagement table references user_id in the users table. |
| Composite Key | A Primary Key composed of two or more columns that, when combined, uniquely identify a row. | In the engagement table, a combination of (user_id, content_id, event_time) might form a composite key to track specific interactions. |
| NOT NULL | Ensures a column cannot contain a NULL value. | name in the users table should be NOT NULL. |
| UNIQUE | Ensures all values in a column are different. (A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints, but only one PK). | email (if it existed) in the users table. |

üìù Exercise 1.2
1.2.1 Identify the Primary Key (PK) for the subscriptions table:

* user_id
* plan
* A composite key of (user_id, start_date)

1.2.2. What key is needed in the engagement table to link it to the content table?
 - Solution 1: The PK is a composite of (user_id, start_date) because a single user can have multiple subscriptions over time.
 - Solution 2: A Foreign Key to content_id.

1.3 DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL commands are used to define or modify the structure of the database objects.

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| CREATE DATABASE | Creates a new database. | CREATE DATABASE UserEngagementDB; |
| CREATE TABLE | Creates a new table with its specified columns, data types, and constraints. | CREATE TABLE users (user_id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100), signup_date DATE); |
| ALTER TABLE | Changes the structure of an existing table (e.g., adding/dropping columns, modifying constraints). | ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE; |
| DROP TABLE | Completely removes a table and all its data from the database. | DROP TABLE users; |
